### Hi! We are _Tech For Ukraine_ :ukraine:
We're an international team of people working to fuel and organize the creation of software aimed at helping the Ukrainian people during the current war with Russia. Our organization has developed technologies such as a missile/air alarm system, a website that encompasses information for Ukrainian refugees, and impending others. Contribution to our open source technologies is valued.
